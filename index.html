                Maybe the questions bubbled up over time. Maybe the realization hit you suddenly. Am I gay? Everyone calls me a girl, but
                I don’t feel like one. Why do I feel different from the people I’m around? Those feelings can be the beginning
                of a journey of self-discovery that can be rewarding, but also extremely daunting.
                <br />
                <br /> ‘You are not alone.’
                <br />
                <br /> If this is what you’re going through, take a breath and remember that there are plenty of people and resources
                to help and support you. Even if facing discrimination is not a concern for you, the anxiety and isolation
                you may feel privately can be all too real.
                <br />
                <br /> “You are not alone,” said iO Tillett Wright, a speaker whose TedxWomen talk, “Fifty Shades of Gay,” has
                more than 2.5 million views. “It’s comical how not alone you are.”
                <br />
                <br /> While it is not possible to get an exact figure on the population of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender
                Americans, a 2015 report by the Public Religion Research Institute suggests that “7 percent of millennials
                identify either as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.” A January 2017 Gallup survey revealed that an
                estimated 4.1 percent of Americans identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, up from 3.5 percent
                in 2012.
                <br />
                <br /> According to a paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, even those numbers may be underestimated
                — as are the challenges that people in this community face.
